# Data Cleaning and Analysis Task

### Objective:

Your task is to clean and analyze the given dataset by following the instructions below. This exercise will help you practice data cleaning techniques and perform basic exploratory data analysis.

### Instructions:

1. Remove Duplicate IDs – Ensure that each ID in the dataset is unique by identifying and removing any duplicate entries.
2. Handle Infinite Values – Identify and drop any rows where the Price Per Unit column contains "inf", as these values are not valid for analysis.
3. Regional Analysis – Calculate the total quantity sold and total value (Quantity × Price Per Unit) for each region. Present your findings in a structured summary.

### Expected Deliverables:

A cleaned dataset with duplicate IDs removed and infinite values handled.
A summary table showing total quantity and total value per region.
A short report explaining your steps and insights from the cleaned data.

Ensure your final dataset is well-structured and formatted correctly. Good luck, and happy analyzing!

### Tool

-Excel- Data souce [Downlaod here] (https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/15OfRuc-pFhXNRODPEFjnxoQss-6HzzxM/edit?gid=1134832740#gid=1134832740)

### Data Cleaning 

I stated by removing Duplicate IDs.  I ensured each ID is unique by keeping only the first occurrence.			
I went further in my Data cleaning by removed rows where the "Price Per Unit" was marked as "inf."			
Rows with Missing Regions were removed, since some entries lacked a region, I excluded them.			


### Result and fildings.

1. I used the pivot table tool to generate the summary table			
2. Calculated total quantity sold per region.			
3. Computed total revenue by multiplying quantity with the price per unit.			

#### Insights from the Cleaned Data:

1. South has the highest total quantity (295) and revenue ($8,049.90).			
2. Asgard has a high total value ($4,499.75) despite fewer items sold.			
3. West ranks second in revenue ($5,950.20), though it ties with East in quantity.
